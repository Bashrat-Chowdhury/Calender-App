# <Calender App>

## Description

This challenge was to create a simple calender app that lets user schedule their day with notes for each hour. The calender is dynamic based on the current hour which is reflected via the hour colours. Furthermore, when the user inputs their hourly notes and to-do items, they can come back to see their notes later as their inputs persisted through refreshes. 

This project was a combtion of HTML, CSS, and javascript. Several thrid party APIs were used for this project including jquery and the Date API.

## Usage

When the user first lands on the calender app, they will see the current date and day. Furthermore, the working hours displayed on the calender will be segregated based on the timeblock colour. The below image is for when the time is 11 AM:

The user can then input their notes which will persist through refreshes:
